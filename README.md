# WebApp 
This is a web development program,  which allows users to browse and search for camps, view 
details and reviews, share their own reviews or publish new contents. In this program, I built the frontend of web with HTML, CSS, JavaScript; developed backend by Node.JS, Express 
to support the web service response; used MongoDB database to store user data.
